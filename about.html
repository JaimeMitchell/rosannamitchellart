    <p>Rosanna Mitchell is a visionary mixed media and botanical print artist whose work is deeply rooted in the intricate beauty of the natural world. She masterfully combines watercolor, ink, acrylic, handmade papers, and found objects to create layered, textured artworks that draw viewers in for a closer look. Her fusion of hand-crafted papers and diverse materials produces a stunning interplay of depth, texture, and vibrant color, reflecting her unique approach to mixed media and botanical print art.</p>

    <p>Her fascination with color developed over 30 years as an interior designer in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the snowy winter landscapes became a natural canvas for experimenting with bold and nuanced palettes. This experience now informs her botanical print and mixed media artwork, allowing her to bring energy, calm, and emotional depth to each piece.</p>

    <p>Rosanna’s artwork has been featured in galleries across Connecticut, California, and Wyoming. In addition to her artwork, she offers workshops and classes in mixed media and botanical art, sharing her techniques and passion with collectors, students, and art enthusiasts. Her work and teaching highlight the expressive possibilities of color, texture, and nature-inspired design.</p>
