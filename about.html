    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
    <p>Rosanna Mitchell is a visionary mixed media and botanical print artist whose work is deeply rooted in the intricate beauty of the natural world.  Mitchell's work is a testament to her unique approach to mixed media art.  She masterfully combines elements of watercolor, ink, acrylic, paper and found objects to create works that draw one in for a closer look.

Rosanna's creation of hand-crafted papers and the fusion of diverse materials create a stunning interplay of texture and depth.  Her art is an explosion of vibrant hues, demonstrating her enthusiasm for the visual impact that colors can convey and the emotional depth they bring to a piece.

She attributes her obsession with color to her 30 years of experience as an interior designer in Jackson Hole, Wyoming where huge windows of the homes she designed overlooked a snowy white landscape for most of the year.  A perfect canvas for experimenting with color to bring a space either filled with energy or calm.

Rosanna's art has been featured in many local galleries in Connecticut, California and Wyoming.</p>
